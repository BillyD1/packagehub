# Package Hub
> An extension for displaying dependencies for different package managers on GitHub

![](screenshot.png)

### Package Manager Support
- [x] Npm.
- [x] Composer (incomplete).
- [ ] Cargo.
- [ ] Yarn.
- [ ] Pip.

### Rationale
Why build this? We already have [npmhub](https://github.com/npmhub/npmhub)?
> npmhub is great, but why should npm have all the fun?
I wanted to see if I could implement something similar while making it easy to
add support for other package managers.
Also, to make it more fun, I decided to accomplish this without any fancy libraries (jQuery) or apis (fetch). So, packagehub should have support for most browsers in use today.

### Todo
- [ ] Design extension logo.

## Related
* [npmhub](https://github.com/npmhub/npmhub) - inspired the idea for this extension.
